# ADR 012: Extended Event-Loop and Real-Time Compatibility Requirements

**Date**: 2026-06-28  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Project maintainers (Hermes agent + human review)

## Context

This ADR extends ADR 002 (Event-Loop Compatibility Requirement). The original four mechanisms (io_uring/liburing, libev, libuv, epoll) remain mandatory compatibility targets.

In addition, the library must now support integration with:

- ESP-IDF Event Loop Library (for ESP32 and other Espressif embedded targets; uses a callback-driven but non-blocking event loop with esp_event_post and handler registration)
- Coroutine-based execution models (e.g., cooperative multitasking via libraries such as libcoro, or language extensions / manual stack switching in pure C; requires the state machine to be re-entrant and yield-friendly with bounded stack usage)
- Real-time programming environments and operating systems that support real-time programming (RTOS such as FreeRTOS, Zephyr, QNX, VxWorks, or Linux with PREEMPT_RT; emphasis on deterministic latency, bounded worst-case execution time (WCET), priority-aware scheduling, avoidance of priority inversion, and no unbounded operations)

Any future change to the core state machine (`src/http2.c`, `include/http2.h`) or sibling protocol modules must remain compatible with how these additional environments consume and drive the API.

## Decision

All changes to the core library **must** be compatible with the usage patterns demonstrated by the original four reference examples **plus** the extended set:

- ESP-IDF Event Loop (non-blocking post/handler model)
- Coroutine drivers (yield points at `feed_input` / `next_event` / `get_output` boundaries; no long-running operations inside the library)
- Real-time schedulers (bounded execution time per call, no malloc in hot paths where possible, support for priority inheritance / ceiling protocols at the application level, avoidance of priority inversion through the library, support for both preemptive and cooperative RT contexts)

The library shall remain:

- System-call free
- Callback free (even when the calling environment uses callbacks, the library itself exposes only pull/push buffer APIs)
- Driven exclusively by `http2_feed_input(ctx, buf, len)`, `http2_next_event(ctx, &event)`, and `http2_get_output(ctx, buf, max)`
- Able to work with edge-triggered, level-triggered, completion-based, event-post, and coroutine-yield models
- Free of assumptions about blocking behavior, threading model, buffer ownership, or scheduling policy
- Suitable for real-time use: all public entry points must have bounded, deterministic execution time; no operations whose duration depends on input size or internal state growth without explicit caller-configurable limits

## Rationale

The expanded set of environments represents critical use cases for embedded, IoT, high-reliability, and latency-sensitive deployments:

- ESP-IDF: Dominant framework for ESP32 Wi-Fi/BT SoCs; many industrial and consumer IoT devices
- Coroutines: Enable lightweight, stack-efficient cooperative multitasking without OS threads; common in embedded and high-concurrency C codebases
- Real-time OSes and RT programming: Required for safety-critical, automotive, avionics, robotics, and industrial control systems where missed deadlines are unacceptable

By explicitly requiring compatibility, we prevent introduction of:

- Unbounded loops or allocations
- Hidden state that breaks re-entrancy or coroutine yields
- Timing assumptions incompatible with RT schedulers
- Callback or thread-local storage usage inside the library

## Consequences

- Any proposed change to the public API or internal state machine must be reviewed against both the original four examples and the extended targets (ESP-IDF, coroutine harnesses, RTOS integration examples).
- New features must be exercisable from all supported environments.
- The `examples/` directory should eventually include reference integrations for the new targets (or at minimum, the core must not preclude them).
- `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/README.md` must list this extended constraint as a first-class invariant.
- Real-time verification (e.g., static analysis for WCET, priority inversion checks) may become part of the CI policy for core changes.

## Verification

- All original four examples continue to build and the new compatibility targets must not introduce breakage.
- The core test (`http2_test`) and dialectic tests continue to pass.
- Future ADRs or PRs that touch the state machine must reference both ADR 002 and ADR 012.
- Documentation must explicitly call out real-time constraints (bounded time, re-entrancy, no syscalls).

This decision ensures the library remains a true reusable state machine suitable for the broadest possible range of high-performance, embedded, and real-time environments.
