# ADR 002: Event-Loop Compatibility Requirement

**Date**: 2026-06-23  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Project maintainers (Hermes agent + human review)

## Context
The library is designed to be used exclusively from calling code that owns the event loop and all system calls. Four canonical event-loop / readiness mechanisms have been implemented as reference examples:

- `liburing` (io_uring)
- `libev`
- `libuv`
- `epoll` (raw Linux epoll)

Any future change to the core state machine (`src/http2.c`, `include/http2.h`) must remain compatible with how these libraries and low-level approaches consume and drive the API.

## Decision
All changes to the core library **must** be compatible with the usage patterns demonstrated by the four reference examples (`liburing_http2_kv`, `libev_http2_kv`, `libuv_http2_kv`, `epoll_http2_kv`).

The library shall remain:
- System-call free
- Callback free
- Driven exclusively by `http2_feed_input(ctx, buf, len)` and `http2_get_output(ctx, buf, max)`
- Able to work with edge-triggered (`EPOLLET`), level-triggered, and completion-based (io_uring) models
- Free of assumptions about blocking behavior, threading model, or buffer ownership

## Rationale
The four event mechanisms represent the dominant approaches to high-performance networking in C:
- Completion-based (io_uring)
- Readiness-based with callbacks (libev, libuv)
- Raw readiness with epoll

By explicitly requiring compatibility with all four, we prevent accidental introduction of:
- Hidden callbacks or function pointers
- Blocking operations inside the library
- Assumptions about buffer lifetime or single-threaded use
- State that cannot be driven from an edge-triggered loop

## Consequences
- Any proposed change to the public API or internal state machine must be reviewed against the four example programs.
- New features (e.g., multi-stream support, flow control, priority) must be exercisable from all four harnesses.
- The examples in `examples/` act as a living compatibility harness. They must continue to compile and run after any core change.
- `AGENTS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` now list this constraint as a first-class invariant.

## Verification
- All four examples continue to build via CMake when the respective libraries are present.
- The core test (`http2_test`) and the examples exercise the same `feed_input` / `get_output` boundary.
- Future ADRs or PRs that touch the state machine must reference this ADR.

This decision ensures the library remains a true reusable state machine rather than becoming tied to any single eventing style.
